# used_car_project
End-to-end product analysis of a used car dataset to derive actionable insights and design an A/B test proposal using SQL, Python, and statistical testing.
This project is an end-to-end simulation of a product analysis task for a used car marketplace like Spinny. The goal is to analyze a large dataset of over 400,000 used car listings to uncover actionable insights, validate them with statistical testing, and propose a data-driven product feature to improve user engagement and business outcomes.

This repository demonstrates a comprehensive skill set for a product analyst role, from raw data cleaning and SQL-based data mining to product sense and A/B test design.

Key Skills Demonstrated
Data Mining & Manipulation: SQL, Python (Pandas)

Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Statistical Analysis: Hypothesis Testing (Two-Sample T-test)

Product Acumen: Insight Synthesis, Feature Proposal

Experimentation: A/B Test Design & Metric Definition

Project Workflow
Data Cleaning & Preparation: Loaded a raw dataset of over 400,000 listings and performed extensive cleaning, including handling missing values, correcting data types, and removing outliers to prepare a reliable dataset for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Leveraged SQL queries for efficient data aggregation and Python (Matplotlib/Seaborn) for visualization to uncover key trends, such as top manufacturers, price distributions, and the impact of vehicle age and mileage.

Statistical Hypothesis Testing: Conducted two-sample t-tests to statistically validate key observations from the EDA, proving that features like 4-Wheel Drive (4WD) and Automatic Transmission command a significant price premium in the market.

Insight Synthesis & A/B Test Proposal: Translated the validated insights into a concrete product feature proposal—an "Adventure Ready" badge for 4WD vehicles—and designed a rigorous A/B test to measure its impact on user engagement.
